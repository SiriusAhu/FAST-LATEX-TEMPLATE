# Introduction

This is a dedicated branch of the FAST LaTeX template, adapted to the Final Year Project (FYP) Proposal MS Word template used by XJTLU Taicang Campus (XEC) for the 2025 AIAC program. It reproduces the Word template's layout and requirements so students can write their FYP Proposal in LaTeX more easily.

> ⚠️ Most features from the original project are preserved, but some features have been removed or simplified in this branch to better match the FYP Proposal requirements (for example, course-code fields in headers/footers have been removed).

- The primary metadata is located in `meta.tex` (for example: supervisor name).

- FYP-specific settings can be found in `config/fyp_settings.tex`; that file includes detailed comments—please edit it as needed.

# Showcase

The compiled PDF using this template is also included in the repository. For detailed effects, please refer to [main.pdf](./main.pdf).
