\section{Referencing (not References!)}

Manage bibliography entries in \texttt{bib/references.bib}. The template now relies on classic \texttt{BibTeX}, so a full build runs \texttt{xelatex → bibtex → xelatex ×2}.

You just need to use \texttt{\textbackslash cite} to cite a reference~\cite{knuth1990}. And this command also supports citing multiple references at once~\cite{knuth1990,dummy-inbook,dummy-article}.
