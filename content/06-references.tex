\section{Referencing (not References!)}

Manage bibliography entries in \texttt{bib/references.bib}. The template uses \texttt{biblatex} with the \texttt{biber} backend for flexible citation styles.

You just need to use \texttt{\textbackslash cite} to cite a reference~\cite{knuth1990}. And this command also support citing multiple references at once~\cite{knuth1990,dummy-inbook,dummy-article}.
